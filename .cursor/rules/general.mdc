This is an Next.js 15 project.

We should have ascii components for all components and pages. It should still be and feel very clean minimal, modern, with different colors.

Use commands to navigate around the website.

This is a website for showing weekend projects - the projects should be written in json, and it should show a timer to the next weekend project.

This is inspired by what mschf does.


We use nerd fonts for the fonts - so feel free to use these instead of icons
